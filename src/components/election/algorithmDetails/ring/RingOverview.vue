            In distributed computing, the ring election algorithm is a method for dynamically electing a coordinator or leader from a 
            group of distributed computer processes. The process with the highest process ID number from amongst the non-failed 
            processes is selected as the coordinator. This algorithm applies to systems organized as a ring, either logically or 
            physically. In this algorithm we assume that the link between the process are unidirectional and every process can send a 
            message to the next active process in the ring.
