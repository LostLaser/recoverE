            In distributed computing, the bully algorithm is a method for dynamically electing a coordinator or leader from a group of distributed computer processes. 
            The process with the highest process ID number from amongst the non-failed processes is selected as the coordinator. This algorithm applies to systems
            where every node is connected.
